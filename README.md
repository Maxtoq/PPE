# PPE : Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning with V2V Communication for Traffic Congestion Optimisation
4th year project at ECE Paris engineering school. 

The goal of the project is to use Reinforcement Learning to learn to optimise the routes of a fleet of autonomous vehicules (our multi-agent system) using Vehicule-to-Vehicule communication.
